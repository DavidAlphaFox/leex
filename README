Leex is a lexical analyzer generator for Erlang. It allows you to
tokenize a textual input stream so that it can be grammatically
analyzed and processed by yecc. It is NOT a part of OTP at this point.

v0.2
----
Added includefile option. Search for include file in current directory
or leex/include lib dir.

Restored text file version of documentation until I edoc and I are in
agreement.

Upgraded erlang_scan.xrl to full erlang tokeniser.

Now use line number of token start.


Thanks to Sébastien Arnaud who did the first packaging of leex for git.
